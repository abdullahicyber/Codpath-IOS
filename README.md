#App Idea
Grocery Waste Reduction
An app designed to help users manage their shopping more effectively and cut down on food wastage. In addition to tracking expiration dates and receiving reminders to use up products before they spoil, users can register their groceries. In an effort to reduce food waste, the app may also recommend dishes depending on what users have left in their refrigerator.
